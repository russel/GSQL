GSQL 1.1:
=========

- No size/scale for types which have no size (like INTEGER)
- New class Select which can be used to build SELECT statements
  including joins, upper limit for returned rows, ordering,
  grouping, etc.
- New class DataSourceProvider which provides a global datasource. Useful
  if you need only a single datasource.
- Data from the database can read into POJOs.
- Select can handle arbitrary large results.
- The "size" field can now be an int or a String like "10,2" for
  DECIMAL(10,2).
- The type can be a string or a constant from java.sql.Types.
- Each column has now a "groovyName" which allows you to map arbitrary
  DB names to properties. These names can also be used to lookup
  columns in results or when building SELECT statements to make your
  code more readable.
- There is a special class called SQLResultObject which can be used
  to build business objects that are filled with data from the DB using
  the Select class. Unlike Expando, the derived classes can have
  extra properties.

Open issues:

- Logging in Select via log4j because java.logging is swallowed inside of
  Tomcat. This violates the standard Groovy logging rules.
- The code in groovy.sql.Sql expects the user to pass in a datasource.
  The Select class expects the datasource from DataSourceProvider. It
  should also allow to pass in a datasource or connection.
- The ant build.xml doesn't work ATM.
- DynaObject should be merged with Expando.
