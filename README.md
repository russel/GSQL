# GSQL

A Groovy expression language for working with SQL.

This project was started by Jeremy (Jez) Rayner many, many moons ago, in the days before Groovy used
Git. The project was extended by "digulla" in a separate (non-Git) repository. Russel Winder merged the work
together into this Git repository, added a Gradle build, removing the Ant and Maven ones, ready for people
to pick up and work on.
